# BootstrapProj_Classical-Music
Tools: Visual Studio Code (VSCode) <br><br>
Hands-on experience with HTML and CSS. This projects is a bootstrap project during my Web Development course. In class, we were to choose a content of our choice, and I specifically chose music as my content/theme. <br><br>
Working on this project was tedious. Although, it helped me to consolidate the lessons I had learnt. It also enabled me discover new methods to build my website which was not a part of the lesson, but has earned me the recognition of my skills and creativity in my class.
