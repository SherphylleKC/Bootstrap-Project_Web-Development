# Bootstrap Exercise Portfolio Assignment
**Tools:** *Visual Studio Code (VSCode)* <br><br>
The purpose of the assignment is to complete a range of exercises related to Bootstrap subject matter. These exercises are listed below, and will then bring them all together as one Bootstrap site which will in turn become a Portfolio of the work that have been completed.

This assignment can be used to bring together and showcase all the Bootstrap exercises that have been completed as one "Bootstrap web site".

It will start by using the *Bootstrap Responsive Grid* exercise. <br><br>

<br><br>

In relation to this exercise, I am able to:
- Change the heading to `<your name, VU student number>` Bootstrap Portfolio.
- Change the images to different images of my choice (optimised and size changed to be the same so to retain the formatting).
- Change the titles and the text for each image to be different, i.e. something related to new photos that will be use.
- Change the Navigation bar words to be similar to that shown below:
  - Home
  - Form
  - Table 1
  - Crousel
  - Table 2
  - Jumbotron
  - Collapsible
  - Card
  - More
    - Model
    - Media Object
    - Tooltip
    - Other exercises
    - Footer
<br>
As we can see with the example, we can also change the background to make the BS Portfolio site more appealing.

This will form the framework for the remainder of the Bootstrap Portfolio.

<!-- Hands-on experience with HTML and CSS. This projects is a bootstrap project during my Web Development course. In class, we were to choose a content of our choice, and I specifically chose music as my content/theme. <br><br>
Working on this project was tedious. Although, it helped me to consolidate the lessons I had learnt. It also enabled me discover new methods to build my website which was not a part of the lesson, but has earned me the recognition of my skills and creativity in my class. -->
